# Lab 4

### Objectives

- Use `input` to get input from a user.
- Cast a `string` to an `integer`.
- Use `try/except` to capture invalid inputs.
- Practice the use of the `if/else` statement.
- Practice the use of a `while` loop.

### Code to write

1. Download the program `lab4.py`

   - In Visual studio code or Mu, open `lab4.py`.

   - Run the code on the Circuit Playground to see what the program does.

2. Modify the program according to the following specifications.

   - The program can be run again until the user decides to quit by pressing the key 'q'. Use a while loop.
   - Once the program is started, it presents the user a menu asking if he/she wants to use the red color (option 1), the green color (option 2), or the blue color (option 3)
   - The input must be casted to an integer and protected again invalid inputs using a try/except statement.

     - The color of the leds must then match the user's choice. Use if statement(s).

   - Test your code thoroughly.
